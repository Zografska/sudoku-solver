# 🔢 Sudoku Solver in Clojure 🧩

This is a **Sudoku Solver** I built **by myself** as part of a university project for the class **Dynamic Programming**.  
It’s written in **Clojure**, a beautiful dialect of **Lisp**. 🌀  

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Solve Sudoku puzzles automatically  
- Explore and apply **dynamic programming techniques**  
- Practice functional programming in a new language (Clojure 💚)  

---

## 👩‍💻 My Experience

This was more than just a project:  

- ✅ I did it completely **by myself**  
- 🎓 Built as part of my **Dynamic Programming** class  
- 🤓 Learned a lot about **recursion, problem decomposition, and dynamic strategies**  
- 🎉 Most importantly: **I had fun!**  
- 🌱 It actually changed the way I feel about programming — more expressive, logical, and creative than I imagined

## ⚡ Features

- 📥 Takes a Sudoku puzzle as input  
- 🧮 Uses Clojure-based algorithms to fill in the blanks  
- 🧠 Dynamic Programming approach for efficiency  
- ✅ Produces a solved Sudoku grid (if solvable)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Make sure you have [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) installed  
3. Run the solver with:  

```bash
clojure sudoku_solver.clj
```
### Input format
```lisp
(def matrix1 [[0 3 0 0 0 1 0 7 0]
              [6 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2]
              [0 0 1 0 4 0 5 0 0]
              [0 7 0 0 0 2 0 4 0]
              [2 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 6]
              [0 4 0 3 0 0 0 1 0]
              [0 0 5 0 3 0 4 0 0]
              [1 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 5]
              [0 2 0 1 0 0 0 3 0]])
```
